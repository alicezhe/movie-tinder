An application that lets users specify their movie preferences (e.g. genre, actors, directors, year released, rating) and gives movie recommendations that the user can swipe through until they find one they like. User preferences can be weighted by importance to filter through movies more easily as well. Users can also click into movies to view detailed information about the movies. 

There will be a swiping page, a trending page, a recommendation page, a review page, an individual movie page, and a profile page.

There will be a client side directory to handle the frontend and a server side directory to handle the backend
